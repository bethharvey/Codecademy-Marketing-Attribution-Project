# Codecademy-Marketing-Attribution-Project

This is a guided project in the Codecademy Data Science Inference Specialist career path. The goal was to use SQL queries and touch attribution to map a typical customer journey and optimize the marketing campaigns for a fictional website called CoolTShirts.

Because this was a guided project, the queries were originally completed in the Codecademy browser, and the original data is not available outside of that environment. The queries I used are included in the presentation, and I included the schema for the dataset.
